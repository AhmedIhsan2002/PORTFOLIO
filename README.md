Hey there! I designed a one page personal profile with just me
Home

The ABOUT ME section contains detail information

It contains the MY SERVICES section
The services that I provide in the field of programming

It contains a MY PORTFOLIO section

Note \ These works that I put on the page are only fake works, and also the site is fictitious only. I am implementing it to solve the task that I was assigned to

It also contains a MY BLOGS section

Finally, the CONTACT ME section

Info about me

That's what it's all about on the page

The site also has a dark mode that I implemented using javascript

What did you use on the site?

1 HTML
2 CSS
3 Fonts-google
4 font-awesome
5 api google-map

Note \ I did not use any external framework or library in the design

Thank you all
 Eng \ Ahmed_Qannan
